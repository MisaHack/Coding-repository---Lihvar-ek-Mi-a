      <h1>PLAN OF APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT</h1>
      <p class="Description">List of future projects</p>

   <div class="Content">
      <p><span class="Start">Following</span> is the list of projects that are planed
         for realising in near future by a small group of entusiastic
         friends and developers who love technology.
         Goal is to make applications that are useful to someone or
         are at least fun to make and use.</p>

      <h2>D&D Character Sheet</h2>
      <p>Because all of us, in our team, love video and board games this is
         obvious choice. Also we particularly like RPG (Role Playing Games)
         so this is our love letter to the genre and more precisely "Dungeons
         and Dragons", granddaddy of them all.</p>

       <h2>Ecology Web Page</h2>
       <p>By suggestion and idea of our member Miloš Panić, great lover of nature and
          health of it's own country, we have plan of realising web page with
          such theme. What will be content of the page and it's look and feel is still
          in discussion.
          But one is for sure, education and information of Serbian citizens
          about problems of surrounding environment is the smallest thing
          we can do to prevent further polution, educate people and prepare
          safe ground for future generations.</p>

       <h2>Atharon Conquest</h2>
       <p>This is actually a real physical board game. It came straight from
          the novel "Atharon: Beginning" and feather of the same author, Nikola Kojić.
          It looks like chess, but fields are more like hexagons. Like chess,
          it has figures but there are some twists in their behaviour and
          how they play. Game is relatively complex to master, but easy to pick up
          and play. So I will be honored that we are going to make it digital,
          and push it to 21. century.</p>

       <h2>Game of Life</h2>
       <p>By suggestion of one of our programmers Marko Jovanović, we will realise
          this quite interesting "self playing game" that simulates how one
          population grows and evolves over time by using simple rules. Game itself
          is the idea of one mathematician.</p>
