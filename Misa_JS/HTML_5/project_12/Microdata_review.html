      <p itemprop="reviewBody">Parents need to know that It is
        based on Stephen King's 1986 novel, which was previously
        adapted into a 1990 TV miniseries. It's very scary, and not
        just in a typical gory slasher or jump scare way; it generates
        actual tingles. (And if you're scared of clowns, it's even worse.)
        Things get pretty gory; characters are stabbed, impaled, and beaten
        with rocks and blunt objects. A boy's arm is bitten off, teens
        shoot guns, and a sheep is killed with a bolt gun. Language is
        also very strong, with a lot of the swearing coming from young
        teens; you'll hear "f--k," "s--t," and more. There's lots of
        bullying, and an abusive father acts in a creepily sexual way
        toward his teen daughter. You can also expect to hear a fair bit
        of sex-related talk among the teen characters, though much of it
        is na√Øve and meant to be humorous. Teens will be eager to see this
        one, but it's not for sensitive viewers or the faint of heart.
